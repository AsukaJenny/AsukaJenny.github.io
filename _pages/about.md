My name is Yumiao and I'm a 2nd year Applied Statistics MS student at University of Michigan. I have studyed less than 4 months to get JLPT N2 Level Certificate with no prior knowledge after my undergraduate graduation in Sun Yat-sen University(中山大学) with Bachelor of Science degree in Information & Computing Science(信息与计算科学). 

News Updates
------
[11/07/22] 📢 Right now I'm on my way starting the 23Fall PhD application cycle, and I'm also anticipating the incoming exicting 2022 FIFA World Cup, which is simultaneous with my own application as well and both are exicting! 🏆

Personal Interest
------
I enjoy music especially J-pop, movies and anime(アニメ)/manga(マンガ), novels by Agatha Christie/Haruki Murakami(村上春樹). Besides, I like soccer best and I am fan of FC Bayern Munich and DFB more than 10 years. In addition, I'm a huge fan of World History/Civilizations and could spend a whole day wandering in Museums. I am enthusiastic in learning new things and I like to discover cities and experience cultural diversity all over the world. You can also see my photography here.

Research Interest
------
In general, I'm interested in cross-disciplinary research: Applications, Combinations & Intersections of Statistics, Information Science, Data Science and Survey Data Analysis, with a focus on Social Science/Education fields. To be specific, I list these 4 concentrations as follows:(although I think some of them are overlapped)
1. Statistics: Machine Learning; Statistical Consulting; Sampling; Experiment Design
2. Information Science: Social Network Analysis; Computional Social Science; Education Learning Technology; Science, Technology, and Society 
3. Data Science: Recommendation Systems; Natural Language Processing;
4. Survey Data Analysis: Survey Design & Data Collection; Survey Data Mangagement; Analysis of Complex Survey Data; Missing Data Imputation

Last but not least, I believe my future research & work will make meaningful contributions to promote Diversity, Equity & Inclusion in the community and I will spare no effort to fulfill my duty.
