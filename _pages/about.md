My name is Yumiao and I'm a 2nd year Applied Statistics MS student at University of Michigan. I have studyed less than 4 months to get JLPT N2 Level Certificate with no prior knowledge after my undergraduate graduation in Sun Yat-sen University(中山大学) with Bachelor of Science degree in Information & Computing Science(信息与计算科学). 

## <i class="fa fa-tag" aria-hidden="true"></i> Personal Interest ##

I enjoy music especially J-pop, movies and anime(アニメ)/manga(マンガ), novels by Agatha Christie/Haruki Murakami(村上春樹). Besides, I like soccer best and I am fan of FC Bayern Munich and DFB more than 10 years. In addition, I'm a huge fan of World History/Civilizations and could spend a whole day wandering in Museums. I am enthusiastic in learning new things and I like to discover cities and experience cultural diversity all over the world. You can also see my photography here.

## <i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></i> Research Interest ##

In general, I'm interested in cross-disciplinary research: Applications, Combinations & Intersections of Statistics, Information Science, Data Science and Survey Data Analysis, with a focus on Social Science/Education fields. To be specific, I list these 4 concentrations as follows:(although I think some of them are overlapped)
1. Statistics: Machine Learning; Statistical Consulting; Sampling; Experiment Design
2. Information Science: Social Network Analysis; Computional Social Science; Education Learning Technology; Science, Technology, and Society 
3. Data Science: Recommendation Systems; Natural Language Processing;
4. Survey Data Analysis: Survey Design & Data Collection; Survey Data Mangagement; Analysis of Complex Survey Data; Missing Data Imputation

Last but not least, I believe my future research & work will make meaningful contributions to promote Diversity, Equity & Inclusion in the community and I will spare no effort to fulfill my duty.
