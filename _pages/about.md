My name is Yumiao, and I am currently a 3rd Year <a onclick='window.open("https://statistics.as.virginia.edu/people/yumiao-hui","_blank")'>PhD student in Statistics</a> at the University of Virginia. Previously, I was an Applied Statistics MS student at the University of Michigan in 2023. I graduated from Sun Yat-sen University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Information & Computing Science in 2020. 

## <i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></i> Research Interest ##

 I'm currently interested in causal inference (Inverse probability weighting; doubly robust estimators), complex survey sampling designs, and semiparametric regression models. Previously, I had some experience in image segmentation and recommendation systems.

Last but not least, I believe my future research & work will make meaningful contributions to promote Diversity, Equity & Inclusion in the community.
## <i class="fa fa-tag" aria-hidden="true"></i> Personal Interest ##

I enjoy music, especially J-pop (recently K-pop), movies, anime/manga, and novels by Agatha Christie/Haruki Murakami. Besides, I am also a soccer fan. In addition, I'm a huge fan of World History/Civilizations and could spend a whole day wandering in Museums. (Of course, Civilization 6 too). I am enthusiastic about learning new things and about discovering cities and experiencing cultural diversity all over the world.
