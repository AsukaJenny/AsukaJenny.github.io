My name is Yumiao and I am currently 3rd Year <a onclick='window.open("https://statistics.as.virginia.edu/people/yumiao-hui","_blank")'>PhD student in Statistics</a> at University of Virginia. Previously I was an Applied Statistics MS student at University of Michigan in 2023. I graduated from Sun Yat-sen University with a Bachelor of Science degree in Information & Computing Science in 2020. 

## <i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></i> Research Interest ##

 I'm currently interested in complex survey sampling design; non-parametric/semi-parametric models; spline smoothing; casual inference(Inverse probability weighting; Doubly Robust Estimators). Previously I had some experience in image segmentation, recommendation systems.

Last but not least, I believe my future research & work will make meaningful contributions to promote Diversity, Equity & Inclusion in the community and I will spare no effort to fulfill my duty.
## <i class="fa fa-tag" aria-hidden="true"></i> Personal Interest ##

I enjoy music, especially J-pop, movies and anime/manga, novels by Agatha Christie/Haruki Murakami. Besides, I like soccer best. In addition, I'm a huge fan of World History/Civilizations and could spend a whole day wandering in Museums. I am enthusiastic about learning new things and I like to discover cities and experience cultural diversity all over the world.
