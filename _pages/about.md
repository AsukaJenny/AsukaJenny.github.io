My name is Yumiao and I'm a 2nd year Applied Statistics MS student at University of Michigan. I have studyed less than 4 months to get JLPT N2 Level Certificate with no prior knowledge after my undergraduate graduation in Sun Yat-sen University(‰∏≠Â±±Â§ßÂ≠¶) with Bachelor of Science degree in Information & Computing Science(‰ø°ÊÅØ‰∏éËÆ°ÁÆóÁßëÂ≠¶). 

## Personal Interest ##
------
I enjoy music especially J-pop, movies and anime(„Ç¢„Éã„É°)/manga(„Éû„É≥„Ç¨), novels by Agatha Christie/Haruki Murakami(Êùë‰∏äÊò•Ê®π). Besides, I like soccer best and I am fan of FC Bayern Munich and DFB more than 10 years. In addition, I'm a huge fan of World History/Civilizations and could spend a whole day wandering in Museums. I am enthusiastic in learning new things and I like to discover cities and experience cultural diversity all over the world. You can also see my photography here.

## Research Interest ##
------
In general, I'm interested in cross-disciplinary research: Applications, Combinations & Intersections of Statistics, Information Science, Data Science and Survey Data Analysis, with a focus on Social Science/Education fields. To be specific, I list these 4 concentrations as follows:(although I think some of them are overlapped)
1. Statistics: Machine Learning; Statistical Consulting; Sampling; Experiment Design
2. Information Science: Social Network Analysis; Computional Social Science; Education Learning Technology; Science, Technology, and Society 
3. Data Science: Recommendation Systems; Natural Language Processing;
4. Survey Data Analysis: Survey Design & Data Collection; Survey Data Mangagement; Analysis of Complex Survey Data; Missing Data Imputation

Last but not least, I believe my future research & work will make meaningful contributions to promote Diversity, Equity & Inclusion in the community and I will spare no effort to fulfill my duty.


# <i class="fa fa-cog fa-fw"></i> About me #
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), where I am fortunate to be coadvised by [Prof. Qifan Song](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~qfsong/) and [Prof. Jean Honorio](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jhonorio/). 
I have obtained an MS degree in Computer Science and Statistics during my Ph.D. study. 
I received my B.Sc. in Mathematics from [Chinese University of Hong Kong](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), with double stream in Computational Applied Mathematics (CAM) and Enrichment Mathematics. 
My academic advisor was [Prof. Ronald Lok Ming Lui](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~lmlui/). I was also an exchange student at [University of Pennsylvania](https://home.www.upenn.edu/). I was an intern at [Amazon Ads](https://advertising.amazon.com/) and [Sensetime Research](https://www.sensetime.com/en).

My research interests include:

* Optimization Theory
* Bandit Algorithms
* Federated Learning
* High Dimensional Statistics
* Deep Learning Theory and Practice

I am actively building and maintaining an open-source Python library for *X*-armed bandit algorithms and benchmarks. Check out [this repository](https://github.com/WilliamLwj/PyXAB).
