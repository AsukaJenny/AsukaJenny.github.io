My name is Yumiao and I am currently 2nd Year <a onclick='window.open("https://statistics.as.virginia.edu/people/yumiao-hui","_blank")'>PhD student in Statistics</a> at University of Virginia. Previously I was an Applied Statistics MS student at University of Michigan in 2023. I graduated from Sun Yat-sen University(中山大学) with a Bachelor of Science degree in Information & Computing Science(信息与计算科学) in 2020. 

## <i class="fa fa-tag" aria-hidden="true"></i> Personal Interest ##

I enjoy music, especially J-pop, movies and anime(アニメ)/manga(マンガ), novels by Agatha Christie/Haruki Murakami(村上春樹). Besides, I like soccer best and I have been a fan of FC Bayern Munich and DFB for more than 10 years. In addition, I'm a huge fan of World History/Civilizations and could spend a whole day wandering in Museums. I am enthusiastic about learning new things and I like to discover cities and experience cultural diversity all over the world. You can also see my photography here.

## <i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></i> Research Interest ##

In general, I'm interested in cross-disciplinary research: Applications, Combinations & Intersections of Statistics, Information Science, Data Science, and Survey Data Analysis, with a focus on Social Science fields. To be specific, I list these 4 concentrations as follows:(although I think some of them overlap)
1. Statistics: Spatial Data Analysis; Machine Learning; 
2. Information Science: Social Network Analysis; Computational Social Science; 
3. Data Science: Recommendation Systems; Natural Language Processing;Text Mining
4. Survey Data Analysis: Analysis of Complex Survey Data; Missing Data Imputation

Last but not least, I believe my future research & work will make meaningful contributions to promote Diversity, Equity & Inclusion in the community and I will spare no effort to fulfill my duty.
