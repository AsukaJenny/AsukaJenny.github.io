My name is Yumiao and I'm a 2nd year Applied Statistics MS student at University of Michigan. I have studyed less than 4 months to get JLPT N2 Level Certificate with no prior knowledge after my undergraduate graduation in Sun Yat-sen University(‰∏≠Â±±Â§ßÂ≠¶) with Bachelor of Science degree in Information & Computing Science(‰ø°ÊÅØ‰∏éËÆ°ÁÆóÁßëÂ≠¶). I enjoy music especially J-pop, movies and anime(„Ç¢„Éã„É°)/manga(„Éû„É≥„Ç¨), novels by Agatha Christie/Haruki Murakami(Êùë‰∏äÊò•Ê®π). Besides, I like soccer best and I am fan of FC Bayern Munich and DFB more than 10 years. 

News Updates
------
[11/07/22] üì¢ Right now I'm on my way starting the 23Fall PhD application cycle, and I'm also anticipating the incoming exicting 2022 FIFA World Cup, which is simultaneous with my own application as well and both are exicting! üèÜ

Research Interest
------
In general, I'm interested in cross-disciplinary research: Applications, Combinations & Intersections of Statistics, Information Science, Data Science and Survey Data Analysis, with a focus on Social Science/Education fields. To be specific, I list these 4 concentrations as follows:(although I think some of them are overlapped)
1. Statistics: Machine Learning; Statistical Consulting; Sampling; Experiment Design
2. Information Science: Social Network Analysis; Computional Social Science; Education Learning Technology; Science, Technology, and Society 
3. Data Science: Recommendation Systems; Natural Language Processing;
4. Survey Data Analysis: Survey Design & Data Collection; Survey Data Mangagement; Analysis of Complex Survey Data; Missing Data Imputation

Last but not least, I believe my future research & work will make a meaningful contribution to promote Diversity, Equity & Inclusion in the community and I will spare no effort to fulfill my duty.

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
